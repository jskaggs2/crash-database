# crash-database

Data describing vehicle crashes are the quantiative basis of our understanding of when, where, how, and why crashes occur, which contributes to the development of crash mitigation measures, such as road safety infastructure that reduce or eliminate loss of life or property. Numerous organizations collect and/or compile crash related data, such as the National Highway Safety Administration and state Departments of Transportation. 

However, these data can be difficult to (1) find, (2) understand, (3) organize, and (4) format for analysis in statistical software, such as R.

The purpose of this project is to centralize crash data from various sources, organize it in a easy to understand way, and provide tools that enable users to manipulate these data using R.
